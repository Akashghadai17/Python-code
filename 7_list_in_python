#2 )REPETITION
print(name*3)
#3 )[]SCICE
print(name[2])
#4 )[:]RANGE
print(name[:4])
#5 )IN MEMBERSHIP
print("Akash" in name)
#6 )NOT IN MEMBER

#BUILT IN FUNCTIONS COMMON TO LISTS AND TUPLES
#1 )len()
print(len(name))
#2 )max()
print(max(name))
#3 )min()
print(min(name))

#MANIPUTATING LIST & UTILIZE FUNCTIONS
#1 )append()
print(name.append("Abhinash"))
print(name)
#2 )insert() INDEX NUMBER IS REQUIRED FOR INSERTING DATA IN YOUR INDEX NUMBER
print(name.insert(3,"Biswajeet"))
print(name)
#3 )remove()
print(name.remove("Abhinash"))
print(name)
#4 )pop() REMOVE LAST ITEM IN LIst
print(name.pop())
print(name)   
#5 )reverse()
print(name.reverse())
print(name)
#6 )sort
name.sort()
print(name)

#sort discending
thislist = ["orange", "mango", "kiwi", "pineapple", "banana"]
thislist.sort(reverse = True)
print(thislist)

#CONVERTING ONE SEQUENCE TYPE TO ANOTHER
#1)LIST TO TUPPLE
tuple(name)
print(name)
#2)TUPPLE TO LIST
list(name)
print(name) 

#LIST TO STRING
#LIST JOIN METHOD
def listtostring(s):
    str=" "
    return(str.join(s))
s=["A","K","A","S","H"]
print(listtostring(s))


#Loop Through the Index Numbers
#Print all items by referring to their index number:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])
#Using a While Loop
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1

#Looping Using List Comprehension
#A short hand for loop that will print all items in a list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
